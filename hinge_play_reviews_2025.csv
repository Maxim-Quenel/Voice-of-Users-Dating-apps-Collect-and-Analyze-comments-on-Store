Something could be done to prevent people from hoarding likes, for example, a cap on the number of likes they can receive. That way, no one gets overwhelmed by likes, and they will either respond or delete it and move on. There also should be an insensitive for women to send likes.

Hinge could easily filter these but doesn't, Tinder owns them and does on their platform. Some days more than 60% of profiles are bogus. Dev responded they use automated tools to address this, they can't be. So simple to do, spam filtering has done this for 25+ years, yet the same predictable profles get through daily, 100s of them. Platform is mostly for D-grade ""influencers"" to advertise and catfish, not meet people.",04-08-2025 00:37,"Thank you for the feedback.

f609fabf-dfe5-415d-85a9-3df4d87bf1d4,A Google user,3,My relationship with this app has been mixed anyway but lately it's looking to become like Tinder with multiple subscription tiers and paying to restore a match if you didn't chat for 2 weeks... that's so unbelievably bad. You could restore the chat and they don't even respond (because that's the norm) so why would anyone do this over unmatching and then matching again??

Not worth using filters on here because they hide your preferred profiles inside the Standout section. I've seen the same twenty profiles locked away in Standout section with no way to interact with them, except through roses that cost money. Maybe I'm locked in Standout too, because I only match with scammers. They've made the Standout UI fancier now, but the idea of it is trash.",15-05-2025 16:14,,92,9.72.1
